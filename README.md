This folder contains my notebooks created as part of various projects on the Kaggle platform. Each notebook focuses on solving specific analytical problems through data cleaning, exploration, and visualization. These projects are part of my learning process as I deepen my understanding of Python libraries for data analysis.

The notebooks cover the following key steps in the data analysis process:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization

These projects emphasize developing proficiency with Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, while also honing skills in data interpretation and presentation through visual insights.
